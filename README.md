## Description
We have three files that we will create  and write in our java script code to try and solve the questions given.
In the first question we  will name  a function called 'swapingCase' that takes an inputString as the parameter and swaps the case of each letter.
In the second question,we defined a function called 'makeArray' that we later tested different inputs in order for us to be able to get the output of numbers between our inputs
In the third question, defined a function called filterPrimeNumbers that filters out prime numbers from an array and used an input of numbers from 1-10 that gave us prime numbers in return
